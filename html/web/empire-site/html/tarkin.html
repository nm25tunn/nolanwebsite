			The governor of the outer rim, Tarkin is one of <a href="palpatine.html">The Emperor's</a> most trusted officials.  Tarkin is a veteran of the clone wars, where he served as
			 a commander within the Republic's military.  He was the architect of the largest Imperial effort to destroy any hope of rebellion in the galaxy and was primarily responsible 
			 for Imperial efforts to crush the alliance in the earlier stage of the Galactic Civil War.  He was commander of the first <a href="deathstar.html">Death Star</a> battlestation 
			 until his demise along with the battle station.
